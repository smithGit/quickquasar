# QuickQuasar - A Portfolio of Quasar Programs for Quick Development of Practical Apps

## Description (1/5/23: This project is in the initial stages of implementation)

This **Quick Quasar Project** is a portfolio of Apps using the Quasar framework for both **Single-Page Applications (SPA)** and **Electron** desktop use.  

## Getting Started: The Portfolio

QQ Example Applications are designated with a qq prefix (qqElec for Electron) and three digit number.  Each is available as a separate GitHub repository.

- [qq101Basexxx]
- qq102yyy
Electron:
- [qqElec101Base](https://github.com/QuickQuasar/qqElec101Base)
- qqElec102 ...
- qqElec103 + pin + ts??

### Dependencies and QQ Conventions

The objective is to provide example apps that accomplish a lot of the underlying infrastructure features in manner that they can be used without the full learning curve required of each feature.  Therefore, even the simplest app has a lot going on.

The dependencies underlying all QQ apps include [Quasar Framework](https://quasar.dev/) Version 2+, which in turn is based on Node.js and Vue version 3+.
In addition, QQ conventions include the following features:

* Pinia common Store and State Management capability.  Starting right off to use Pinia provides quite a bit of flexibility as your application groes in complexity.
* TypeScript - a superset of JavaScript that has compelling code integrity features that make it favored for serious business applications.  The QQ examples provide sufficient examples on how to use TypeScript that, hopefully, the learning curve wil be shortened considerably.
* Vite
* Eslint - to enforce code consistency.  A goal is to end up with code that several people can work on and know what is going on.
* Vue Router
* Code documentation with extensive comments, in particular, comments describing the overall app in the App.vue module in all cases.
* The development platform used is Windows - Linux should work but has not been tested.  Also, the focus is on programs subject to continual development, so little attention has been paid to the productive deployment of the example apps.
* [D3 Data-Driven-Documents](https://d3js.org/) is a tremendous system for graphics and other uses, and is accentuated in several apps but not required.
